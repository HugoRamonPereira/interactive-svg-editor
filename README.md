This is the main page and this is where the canvas sits with the editor where you can add rectangles and stars and modify and move them across the canvas.

#### Toolbar

At the left side of the canvas there is a toolbar with 4 tools:
1. Move
2. Configure
3. Rectangle
4. Star

## Rectangle configurations

When you add a rectangle to the canvas you can modify its corners by increasing the border-radius and it will give the rectangle a rounded look.

As for the star you can increase the amount of points it has and move it around the canvas.
