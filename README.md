## Home Page

This is the main page and this is where the canvas sits with the editor where you can add rectangles and stars and modify and move them across the canvas.

#### Toolbar

At the left side of the canvas there is a toolbar with 4 tools:
1. Move
2. Configure
3. Rectangle
4. Star

## Rectangle configurations

When you add a rectangle to the canvas you can modify its corners by increasing the border-radius and it will give the rectangle a rounded look.

## Star configurations

As for the star you can increase the amount of points it has and move it around the canvas.
